### Algorithms (Difficultyâ€”simple | 15 minutes)


```tsx
/**
 Problem:

 Implement a JavaScript function that takes an array of product objects and
 a price filter value as input. The function should return a new array containing
 only the products with a price lower than or equal to the filter value.

 Optimize the function for time and space complexity
 */
const results = filterProductsByPrice(products, maxPrice);
```

### Technical Discussion (30-35 minutes)

```textmate
You are building a single-page application (SPA) for an e-commerce platform.
The application will have product listings, detailed product pages with dynamic content,
a shopping cart, and a checkout process.

The application needs to integrate with a Graphql based API to fetch the data and handle user authentication.
```

Propose an architecture for the application considering the following scenario
1. [ ] Component Structure
2. [ ] Data Flow
3. [ ] Communication with Backend Services
4. [ ] State Management
