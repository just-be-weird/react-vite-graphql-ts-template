## Prerequisite

### For locally cloned repo

1. Make sure you've a node version equal to higher than v18. Install node via version manager for the node - nvm ðŸ”— [view instruction](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/just-be-weird/react-vite-graphql-ts-template.git nivoda-int`
3. Checkout `git checkout frontend/md/q/tree-fri`
4. Run `npm i`
5. Run the project by `npm run dev`

### Using Codesandbox.io

1. Need to Sign in to [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) using your github account

## Challenge

1. **Data Retrieval:** We'll begin by fetching data from the provided [Graph](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#graphql)/[REST](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/episode) endpoint.
This endpoint should return a list of episodes, each list item containing information like name, episode number, and a section dedicated to displaying the first three characters' image previews along with a button to load more characters.

2. **Random Rating Assignment:** To add some engagement, we'll assign a random rating between 0 and 5 to each episode within the retrieved data.

3. **Interactive Filtering:** Leveraging the updated data, we'll build a user-friendly search experience. This will include two filtering functionalities:
   1. **Search by Episode Name:** Users can search for specific episodes by entering their names in a dedicated filter box.
   2. **Filter by Episode Rating:** Additionally, users can filter the displayed episodes based on their assigned ratings. The filter options will include individual buttons or sliders for ratings between 1 and 5.
